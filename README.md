# Jarvis
Jarvis helps perform multiple tasks and google searches I make everyday and format them in the command line. Jarvis performs tasks such as:
  - Giving me the Boston weather
  - Reading me Wired.com top article
  - Scraping Coinbase.com for cryptocurrency price.
  - Tells me how long it will take to commute to college
  - Sends me a text of the weather every morning
  - WIP: telling me the top spotify songs
